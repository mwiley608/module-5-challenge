Bootcamp Module 5 Challenge
The Pandas script Pymaceuticals_main.ipynb was developed as a homework assignment to analyze fictional pharmaceutical study data comparing the effects of different treatments on tumor size in mice. The script imports two csv files located in the Resources folder, then combines the two datasets based on the mouse ID used in the study. The script analyzes the measured tumor volume over the span of the study.

I used the provided Pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb file located in the Resources folder as a guide for the style and structure of my script. In addition, the initial code for the required dependences and data files were provided in the starter file.

To determine the syntax to detect duplicates based on multiple columns, I referenced Example 4 on the webpage: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-duplicate-rows-in-a-dataframe-based-on-all-or-selected-columns/ 

I used the syntax on how to drop rows with a specific string from Example 1 on the webpage: https://www.statology.org/pandas-drop-rows-that-contain-string/

I followed the syntax to aggregate multiple functions provided in the examples on the webpage: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pandas-dataframe-aggregate/ 

The use of “.sort_values(ascending=False)” to sort the first bar chart was provided by Adam Siens and Jacob Field during Bootcamp Office Hours on August 3, 2023. 

To find the syntax to change the color of the outlier marker, I referenced the webpage: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25075023/matplotlib-boxplot-outlier-color-change-if-keyword-sym-is-used
